# android-compass
IN DEVELOPMENT
 
Similar to compass but the direction is a coordinate

It shows th google map in current location and a arrow in destination direction

The map all the time is looking at front in the same direction of person (device)

Thanks to iutinvg i'm using his project https://github.com/iutinvg/compass.git for the compass sensor.
